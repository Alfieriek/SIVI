# Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (SIVI)

Code to reproduce the results in [Semi-Implicit Variational Inference](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/yin18b/yin18b.pdf). 

# Data sets
The data for SIVI_1d.py, SIVI_2d.py, SIVI_NB.py are self-generated in the python script.  <br />
The "waveform" data for SIVI_LR.py is in the data folder. <br />
The MNIST data for SIVAE.py is  self-contained. <br />
Or of course, just try semi-implicit VI with your own datasets and probabilistic models.<br />
